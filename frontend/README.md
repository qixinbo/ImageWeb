## Why Kaibu?

`Kaibu` is [a small island in Fiji](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kaibu+Island/), and we name it to pay tribute to the open source image processing package [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/)/[ImageJ](https://imagej.net). Meanwhile, the layered design of Kaibu is inspired by [Napari](https://napari.org/) which is also named after an island. `Kaibu` in Chinese(开步) means "to step forward", and yes, it is time to step forward with Kaibu!
